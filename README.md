## Key Insights and Findings üîç
#### 1. Anxiety Disorders

Trend (1990‚Äì2017): Anxiety disorder prevalence increased steadily from 3.96% in 1990 to a peak of 4.004% in 2010 before a slight decline to 4.002% by 2017. The consistent rise suggests increasing societal stress or improved diagnostics globally. Governments should focus on awareness campaigns and early diagnosis to mitigate this trend.

#### 2. Bipolar Disorder
Heatmap Analysis: Bipolar disorder prevalence is concentrated in North America, Europe, and parts of Asia, indicating possible correlations with urbanization and societal pressures. Expand mental health infrastructure in densely affected areas and encourage early screening.

#### 3. Alcohol Dependency
Top 5 Countries with the Highest Rates:

‚Ä¢ Belarus: 5.3%

‚Ä¢ Russia: 5.2%

‚Ä¢ Eastern Europe (Regional): 5.1%

‚Ä¢ Ukraine: 5.1%

‚Ä¢ Estonia: 4.9%

Eastern Europe has a significantly higher prevalence, reflecting cultural and societal influences. Introduce stricter alcohol regulations and accessible rehabilitation services.

#### 4. Schizophrenia

Top Countries with Highest Rates:

‚Ä¢ Netherlands: 0.37%

‚Ä¢ Australia: 0.36%

‚Ä¢ Australasia: 0.36%

High rates in developed nations suggest better diagnostic systems and reporting. Strengthen support programs tailored for early detection and treatment.


#### 5. Eating Disorders

Top Countries with Highest Rates:

‚Ä¢ Australia: 0.84%

‚Ä¢ Australasia: 0.81%

‚Ä¢ Luxembourg: 0.69%

Cultural pressures in regions like Australia contribute significantly to the high prevalence. Implement culturally sensitive awareness campaigns and strengthen preventive healthcare services.


#### 6. Depression

Top Countries with Highest Rates:

‚Ä¢ Greenland: 6.46%

‚Ä¢ Morocco: 5.61%

‚Ä¢ Lesotho: 5.42%

Greenland‚Äôs high prevalence suggests unique environmental and societal stressors while developing nations like Lesotho highlight healthcare disparities. Target high-risk regions with comprehensive mental health policies and counselling services.
